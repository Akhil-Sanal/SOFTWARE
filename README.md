# Train Ticket Booking System

This is a simple **Train Ticket Booking System** implemented in Python. It allows users to **register, log in, book train tickets, view previous bookings, and reset passwords** if forgotten.

## Features

- **User Registration:** New users can create an account with a secure password.
- **User Login:** Existing users can log in using their credentials.
- **Password Recovery:** Users can reset their password by answering a security question.
- **Train Ticket Booking:** Users can book tickets for available trains by providing passenger details.
- **View Previous Bookings:** Users can view their past bookings.
- **Download Tickets:** Users can save their booked tickets as a CSV file.

## How to Run

1. Install Python (if not installed already).
2. Ensure `passdata.dat` (for storing login credentials) and `uu.csv` (for previous bookings) exist in the project directory.
3. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python project_final.py
